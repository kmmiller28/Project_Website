##Task
For this project I had to work with one other student to create a multi-page web application that utilized techniques that we had learned in the class up to that point. 
##Summary
This program was my junior year web development project that I worked on with one other student. We used HTML5 and CSS3 to build the application.
##Functionality
In the program, the main page has a navigation bar that allows the user to navigate to other sections of the restaurants website. There is a description of the restaurants mission as well as their hours of operation. 
HTML5, CSS3
